			\subsection{Search Engine Optimization}
			Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's "natural" or un-paid ("organic") search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.


			As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.


			The proposed action to maintain the SEO will be:

		\section{Responsive Design}
			\subsection{Content management system}
			\begin{quote}
			A Content Management System (CMS) is a computer program that allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as preservation from a central interface. Such systems of content management support procedures to achieve workflow in a collaborative environment. These procedures can be manual steps or an automated cascade. 

				\subsubsection{Main function of CMS}
			The core function and application of content management system are to present information on websites. CMS features vary widely from system to system. Simple systems showcase a handful of features while other releases, notably enterprise systems, provide more complex and powerful functions. Most CMS includes Web-based publishing, format management, revision control (version control), indexing, search, and retrieval. The CMS increments the version number when new updates are added to an already-existing file. A CMS may serve as a central repository containing documents, movies, pictures, phone numbers, and technical information. CMS can be used for storing, controlling, revising, semantically enriching and publishing documentation.

				\subsubsection{WordPress}
WordPress is a free and open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL which runs on a web hosting service. Features include a plug-in architecture and a template system.

					\item Plug-ins installation 
					\item Widgets integration

%---------IMPLEMENTATION AND Disaster Management---------------------
\normalsize
%\pagenumbering{arabic}

\chapter{Implementation and Disaster Management}

		\section{Implementation plan}
		\begin{quote}
		Implementation is almost the last phase of the web development. Phases of implementation are:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Requirements and Functional Specification
			\item Develop a Site Map
			\item Product Review and Selection
			\item Develop a Page Layout and Design
			\item Develop Web Site Content
			\item Validate/Develop Web Site Structure and Usability
			\item Migrate Development Web Site to Production Environment
	 		\item Validate Production Web Site
			\item Schedule Ongoing Review Points
			\item Implement Search Engine Optimization
		\end{enumerate}

			\subsection{Requirements and Functional Specification}
			Assuming that the requirement for a web site has already been identified, the next step is to decide what features and functions you want the web site to support.

			For example, do you want to develop a 'Private Members Area' and run a subscription service? Or perhaps you want to sell products and services? You may even want to develop a customized web application or service!

			It is a good idea to 'brainstorm' your requirements and create three lists:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Features that must be available from day one.
			\item Features that must be developed and become available over time (say 3-5 days).
			\item Features that would be 'nice to have' but are not imperative to the success of the web site.
		\end{itemize}
		Once these lists are complete it is worth spending some time creating a more formal Requirements Specification document. This can then be used when talking to potential suppliers to ensure that a) all your needs are met and b) you don't end up being seduced by features that you don't need!

		The importance of this part of the process cannot be overstated as time spent here will help ensure that you don't waste time and money later in the project.

			\subsection{Develop a Site Map}
			Customers are often surprised that we recommend developing the outline 'site map' this early in the project. The reasoning is that the site map will help you scale the project. There is a world of difference between creating a web site with 5 pages and one with world of latest technology!

			At this stage there is no need to define every last detail of every page - after all, the site map will always be an evolving specification.

			Once complete, it is a good idea to review your Requirements Specification document and update if required. For example, if your site map shows a private members area then this should be reflected in the Requirements Specification.

			\subsection{Product Review and Selection}
			Soon after the Requirements Specification and a Site Map, you are now ready to decide just how you want to create and manage your new web site. The Effective Internet Presence offers:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The CEO will work with you throughout the rest of the implementation
			\item Provide you with online resources (e.g. video tutorials and product documentation) to help you familiarize yourself with the product
			\item Create a simple demonstration web site so you can determine the power and flexibility of Web 
			\item Introduce you to relevant case-studies and testimonials to help build your awareness of the company
		\end{itemize}	

			\subsection{Develop a Page Layout and Design}
			It is at this point the graphical presentation and layout of the web site needs to be defined. Once the design, or in some cases designs, have been established the Effective Internet Presence will develop corresponding Master Pages, ensuring that the underlying scripts and structure comply with the latest web standards.

			\subsection{Develop Web Site Content}
			With your web site installed and configured on a secure Effective Internet Presence server, you can now begin building your web site by defining pages, images and supporting documents as required (and using the site map document prepared earlier) as reference.

			\subsection{Validate/Develop Web Site Structure and Usability}
			As the web site content is developed it is good practice to validate each page against the relevant web standards. This may be achieved using the tool built into the HTML Editor or via the W3C Markup Validation Service.

			Once the content loading is complete, it is important that the web site is (again) checked thoroughly for all aspects of form and function. It is also a good idea to show the new web site to a number of potential users for usability and general feedback. All comments should be reviewed and the site 'adjusted' accordingly and then retested.

			\subsection{Migrate Development Web Site to Production Environment}
			Once you are happy that the new web site is stable and presented to a production/public standard, it may be migrated to your chosen production hosting environment. Any related services such as DNS or email hosting should also be taken care of at this time.

			The Effective Internet Presence will develop a Migration Schedule for your web site to ensure that the migration goes smoothly with the minimum of disruption.

		 	\subsection{Validate Production Web Site}
			Before 'going live' the web site should once again be fully checked to ensure that all services are working correctly. As always, the CEO will work with you to ensure that nothing is overlooked or forgotten.

			Once this check has been completed satisfactorily, the web site can 'go live' and face its public for the first time.

			\subsection{Schedule Ongoing Review Points}
			Once live, the Effective Internet Presence will schedule a number of ongoing review points to make sure that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Your web site is performing correctly and to your expectations
				\item To make you aware of any new features or facilities that have been added to the Web Management Studio application suite
				\item Obtain feedback from your experience so that this may be considered when developing the product.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\subsection{Implement Search Engine Optimization}

 		\section{Disaster management}

		Understanding the disaster management will help the client to avoid the future problems. In technical projects, only a small percentage succeed: meaning they are completed on time, within budget, and with all required features. But the causes of these failures are well understood. The most common and debilitating project management errors can be captured under three fundamental project management principles:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Context
			\item Entropy 
			\item Society.
		\end{enumerate}

		The following table summarizes these pitfalls against a project life-cycle model. The chart indicates both the project stage(s) in which a pitfall can most effectively be addressed and the relative importance of attending to it in the stage. 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A 'X' mark indicates that significant attention to the pitfall in the stage is critical for project
success. 
			\item A 'Y' mark indicates that appropriate attention to the item in this stage will substantially increase your chances of success.
			\item A 'Z' mark indicates {\it maintenance mode}: check in frequently to ensure that entropy has not taken over. 
		\end{enumerate}

Note that the close-out stage of the project demands attention to all the pitfalls. Evaluating how these pitfalls
were handled in the course of the project is an invaluable part of a project post mortem.

		Effective Internet Presence has the technology, tools, and resources to manage the web development project without any fail since last half decades. At the same time, Effective Internet Presence will arrange the software backup system for the profiles database (It will allow you to restore your site if it is defaced/hacked. At the beginning of each day, the system creates a new backup file for the entire MySQL database. The system saves the backup files for the last four days. That means at any point we will be able to roll back the database to the exact state it was in on any of those 4 previous days.)

\chapter{Marketing Strategies}
\begin{quote}
Internet advertising is the sole of marketing strategy for the web business. The Internet advertising uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. It includes email marketing, search engine marketing, social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. Like other advertising media, online advertising frequently involves both a publisher, who integrates advertisements into its online content, and an advertiser, who provides the advertisements to be displayed on the publisher's content. Other potential participants include advertising agencies who help generate and place the ad copy, an ad server who technologically delivers the ad and tracks statistics, and advertising affiliates who do independent promotional work for the advertiser.
\end{quote}		
			
		\section{Search Engine Marketing (SEM)}
			\subsection{Search Engine Optimization}
		\begin{quote}
		Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's "natural" or un-paid ("organic") search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.

As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of back links, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.

The proposed action to maintain the SEO will be:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Review of your site content or structure
		\item Technical advice on website development: for example, hosting, redirects, error pages, use of JavaScript
		\item Content development
		\item Management of online business development campaigns
		\item Keyword research
		\item SEO training
		\item Expertise in specific markets and geographies
	\end{itemize}
\end{quote}
		\subsection{How to get SEO contents}
		\subsubsection{Unique Content} 
\begin{quote}
Search engines do like is the consummate unique content. We have seen the rise in importance of content creation as a marketing tool over the last few years. People use the web to find information that is why the search engines are putting such a high value on unique content. Creating fabulous contagious content that begs to be shared such as videos, blog posts and e-books also have a tremendous side benefit.  That benefit is that people will link to your website or blog and hence the search engines gives you immense ticks in its search engine calculations the more often backlinks are created for your blog and website from other websites.
\end{quote}
		\subsubsection{Increasing prominence}
\begin{quote}
A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to the most important pages may improve its visibility. Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrase, so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep the search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's meta data, including the title tag and meta description, will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listing, thus increasing traffic. URL normalization of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the canonical link element or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all counts towards the page's link popularity score.
\end{quote}
		\subsubsection{Content updating}
\begin{quote}
Updating the contents can make the site get more score and hence achieve the position of market leader. The contents always need to update according to the time and trend.
 \end{quote}
		\subsubsection{Backlink building}
\begin{quote}
SEO experts generally agree that off-page link building techniques can contribute around 80 percent of effectiveness in any SEO campaign. Off-page optimization or building links is by far the most significant activity for assisting us in getting our website well ranked in search engines. And the key driving force in this is backlinks.

A link, or backlink, is the link that you use to be brought to another page. Backlinks is incredibly noteworthy because they are basically like votes for your page that tell search engines that other webpages like and utilize your page for information. The more websites that you have linked or voting for your webpage, the higher your ranking will be. 
\end{quote}

			\subsection{Sponsored search}
			\begin{quote}
			Sponsored search (also called sponsored links or search ads) allows advertisers to be included in the sponsored results of a search for selected keywords. Search ads are often sold via real-time auctions, where advertisers bid on keywords. In addition to setting a maximum price per keyword, bids may include time, language, geographical, and other constraints. Search engines originally sold listings in order of highest bids. Modern search engines rank sponsored listings based on a combination of bid price, expected click-through rate, keyword relevancy, and site quality.
			\end{quote}

		\section{Display advertising}
\begin{quote}
Display advertising conveys its advertising message visually using text, logos, animations, videos, photographs, or other graphics. Display advertisers frequently target users with particular traits to increase the ads' effect. Online advertisers (typically through their ad servers) often use cookies, which are unique identifiers of specific computers, to decide which ads to serve to a particular consumer. Cookies can track whether a user left a page without buying anything, so the advertiser can later re-target the user with ads from the site the user visited.

			\subsection{Web banner advertising}
Web banners or banner ads typically are graphical ads displayed within a web page. Many banner ads are delivered by a central ad server.

Banner ads can use rich media to incorporate video, audio, animations, buttons, forms, or other interactive elements using Java applets, HTML5, Adobe Flash, and other programs.

			\subsection{Floating ad}
A floating ad, or overlay ad, is a type of rich media advertisement that appears superimposed over the requested website's content. Floating ads may disappear or become less obtrusive after a preset time period.

			\subsection{Interstitial ads}
An interstitial ad displays before a user can access requested content, sometimes while the user is waiting for the content to load.

		\section{Text ads}
A text ad displays text-based hyperlinks. Text-based ads may display separately from a web page's primary content, or they can be embedded by hyperlinking individual words or phrases to advertiser's websites. Text ads may also be delivered through email marketing or text message marketing. Text-based ads often render faster than graphical ads and can be harder for ad-blocking software to block

		\section{Media Purchase Advertising}

Internet advertising is constantly changing and shifting towards automation and a digital-centric focus for planning. This means that new and innovative online marketing and interactive advertising options like behaviorally and contextually targeted display advertising, video advertising, digital TV and radio advertising are being introduced at a rapid pace.

To launch a successful traditional online display advertising campaign, media buyers and ad campaign strategists need extensive knowledge of online media buying and planning, including online media, ad placement, ad distribution platforms and campaign monitoring and analysis tools. In addition, it requires a constant awareness and intuitive understanding of target audiences. And, because of the continual complexities and ever-changing fragmentation of online media, managing a successful online display advertising campaign only grows more challenging over time.

		\subsection{Online Media Planning and Buying Services}
The Effective Internet Presence offers an Online Media Planning and Buying Services solution for traditional online media that is comprised of a planning phase (discovery, strategy, online media research, price negotiation), an implementation and execution phase and campaign management (reporting, analysis, ROI projections and campaign optimization). The online Media Planning and Buying Service can be part of a larger, full-scale Internet marketing campaign that may include search marketing, social media and mobile marketing or can be executed as an individual online display advertising campaign.

			\subsubsection{Online Media Plan}
There are currently many inconsistencies in online advertising. There are also limited standards in this industry presently. Therefore, the first step in online media planning and buying must be the development of a comprehensive media plan that includes the clients' goals and objectives, campaign strategy, media research, implementation plan development and ROI projections.

Our experienced media buying professionals work closely with the client to develop an online media strategy, conduct media research, determine the optimum media mix, placement method, targeting and ultimately the launch of the online advertising campaign. We use our expertise and our buying power to target the best placement outfits on the web for our clients' online media placements. The placement of online media can be executed via direct media buys or through online ad networks, ad exchange networks and demand-side networks (DSP).

			\subsubsection{Campaign Goals and Discovery}
At the start of the campaign planning process, we gather from the client the basic information that is vital to a successful advertising campaign. Key subjects that will be addressed are: campaign goals and objectives, market overview, target audience, ad creative, campaign integration, available budget and success metrics.

			\subsubsection{Campaign Strategy}
Based on the information we have gathered from the client, we will brainstorm to develop media buying concepts that will serve as a roadmap for our media research and media selection for the campaign. Once we have the clients' approval for our concepts and which media buys to pursue, we develop a strategy for how to conduct our online media research, planning and negotiations.

		\subsection{Online Media Mix}
Based on the clients' goals and objectives and campaign strategy Effective Internet Presence assesses a variety of online advertising channels and ad delivery platforms to ensure the most effective and lucrative media mix for the online advertising campaign. A typical online advertising campaign may include sponsored links, graphical banner ads, sponsorships and rich media ads (animated banners and video ads).

			\subsubsection{Sponsored Links}
Sponsored links typically appear in an 'Advertising Section' or 'Sponsored Links' area of popular vertical market web sites. Sponsored links not only drive qualified traffic to a web site, but often also result, through inbound links with keyword-rich anchor text, to higher rankings in the organic listings of the major search engines. Sponsored links can have a higher click-through rate then static banner display advertising because visitors are often more prone to click on a relevant, on topic, sponsored link versus a traditional banner advertisement. Sponsored links are often purchased directly from the publisher at a fixed rate per month with a minimum of 30 days.

			\subsubsection{Sponsorships}
When an advertiser has paid to "host" or "owns" a page or section of a website it is considered a sponsorship. With sponsorships an advertisers establishes a more unique advertising opportunity than afforded by typical rotating advertisements. Web users often have a more favorable view of advertising that blends into the content experience and they have a built-in advantage that it ties the advertiser to information, an event, or a venue that reinforces its brand in a positive, yet not overtly commercial manner.

			\subsubsection{Banner and Rich Media Advertising}
Banner and rich media ads appear in fixed and guaranteed positions or floating on top of web pages with links to an advertiser's web site or landing page. They may also be served as multi-sized ads throughout a section of a site or as run of site (ROS) ads to be served throughout the entire web site.

Banners are the most common type of online display advertising. They can be contextually, behaviorally, demographically and geographically targeted and retargeted, and come in static and animated form in a broad variety of square and rectangular sizes. Rich media ads typically include Flash ads, streaming audio/video, all of which are different types of display advertising media.

Banner ads and rich media ads are used to generate targeted sales and leads and/or build brand awareness. They are offered in a variety of flexible pricing models, including pay-per-impressions (CPM), cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-action (CPA), per lead or by revenue share pricing.

Banner ad and rich media ad campaigns can have extensive reach through direct ad placement at vertical web properties or through ad networks and ad exchange network with thousands of publisher/affiliate web sites.
		\subsection{Ad Delivery Methods}
Many media buyers and online marketers are still buying media on a site-by-site basis, effectively handpicking the web publishers that meet their requirements and fit their budget. However, that is not necessary today as more efficient systems to buy display advertising are available. Buying online display advertising through an ad network or ad exchange network will lead to greater efficiencies, higher reach, more accurate targeting and often lower media cost for the advertiser.

The Effective Internet Presence has the deep knowledge and experience with display advertising technologies to deploy and manage these turnkey display advertising networks and run campaigns using a variety of ad networks, ad exchange networks and DSP's.

			\subsubsection{Direct Ad Placement}
Agency media buyers or online marketers at companies that execute their online media campaigns in-house typically buy on a site-by-site basis selecting the web publishers that meet their requirements and fit the budget. The ad agency media buyer or in-house marketer works directly with the publishers' media representative to launch their campaigns. In-house marketers with small budgets may also use a self-serve ad placement system at one of the large ad networks or an ad exchange network to launch an online banner ad campaign. In-house marketers often provide their own ad creative directly to the publishers.

			\subsubsection{Online Ad Networks}
Ad Networks use proprietary technology to serve, track and report on the distribution and delivery of online creative using efficient ad management systems. Ad Networks usually work directly with an advertiser or agency acting as an aggregated of premium advertising inventory for primarily high profile web sites. In a market where access to quality media is limited, Ad Networks offer advertisers and agencies increased reach into quality media environments and to a certain extend targeting through behavioral, demographic and contextual targeting. Ad Networks now also increasingly offer performance-based pricing, usually for left over inventory, as an alternative to CPM pricing.

			\subsubsection{Ad Exchange Networks}
An Ad Exchange Network is essentially a hub for web publishers to connect with agencies and online marketers to sell or buy ads at optimum prices through an auction-type system. They typically serve niche web sites, blogs, gaming sites and online forums that do not have a sales force to sell ad inventory and rely primarily on ad exchange networks to fill their ad space.

Using the auction-based system publishers set a minimum or reserve price for their inventory and agency media buyers and online marketers bid on inventory that meets specific targeting criteria. Advertisers using the exchange typically can set rules that automatically alter bid prices according to how well the ad inventory is performing. Some ad exchange networks take a cut off each transaction others charge a flat fee to publishers and other affiliated ad networks that are part of the exchange.
		
			\subsubsection{Demand-side Platforms}
Demand-side platforms optimize the placement of ads on the Web, in real time. They value, buy and optimize ads on an impression-by-impression basis in real-time, across ad networks and ad exchanges operated by Google (DoubleClick), Yahoo (RightMedia), Microsoft Advertising, and others, thereby increasing ROI for advertisers through automated, campaign-specific algorithms that process hundreds of thousands of ad decisions a second.

		\subsection{Campaign initiation and Management}
Once an ad campaign is running, we utilize a sophisticated online tracking system that continuously monitors each component of the campaign and tracks every respondent in a unified console from the initial click-through to the completed action (lead, download or sale). Through post-campaign analysis, we provide our clients with an insight on which components of the campaign are working and which need to be improved.
